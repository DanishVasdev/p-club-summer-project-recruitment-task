# Assignment_1 

The task was to find a nonce value which when appended to the end of an input string produced a hash value smaller than a target.
This can be done only by brute force method since hashing functions are preimage resistant.
No prediction can be made about the hash value as the probability of getting any value is uniformly distributed.
Hence the values can simply be checked one by one till the required value is found.
